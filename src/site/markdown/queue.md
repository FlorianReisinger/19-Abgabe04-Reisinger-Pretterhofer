### StringQueue-Klasse ##

The StringQueue class displays a queue for Strings which works with FIFO(First in, First out).
It is an ordered list of objects with its use limited to insert elements at the end of the list and deleting elements from the start of list

The Java-Commands are:

- Queue.add(), to add an element at the tail of the queue
- Queue.remove(), This method removes and returns the head of the queue
- Queue.peek(), This method is used to view the head of queue without removing it
- Queue.element(), This method is similar to peek(). It throws NoSuchElementException when the queue is empty
- Queue.poll(), This method removes and returns the head of the queue
- Queuesize(), This method return the number of elements in the queue
